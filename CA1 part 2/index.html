    <h1>Rottweiler</h1>
    <p> <strong>Rottweiler </strong> (/ˈrɒtwaɪlər/, UK also /-vaɪlər/)<sup>[1][2]</sup> is a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed">breed</a> of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large<sup>
            [3][4] </sup> or large.<sup>[5][6]</sup> The dogs were known in German as <em> Rottweiler Metzgerhund </em>,
        meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs,<sup> [7][8] </sup> because their main use was to herd livestock <sup>[3]</sup>
        and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market.<sup>[7] </sup>This continued until the mid-19th century when
        railways replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweilers are now
        also used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs, and police dogs.<sup>[9]</sup>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>According to the FCI Standard, the Rottweiler is considered to be one of the oldest dog breeds. Its origin goes
        back to Roman times. These dogs were kept as herder or driving dogs. They marched over the Alps with the Roman
        legions, protecting the humans and driving their cattle. In the region of Rottweil, these dogs met and mixed
        with the native dogs in a natural crossing. The main task of the Rottweiler now became the driving and guarding
        of the herds of cattle and the defence of their masters and their property. This breed acquired its name from
        the old free city of Rottweil and was known as the "Rottweil butcher's dog". The butchers bred this type of dog
        purely for performance and usefulness. In due course, a first rate watch and driving dog evolved which could
        also be used as a draught dog.<sup>[3][10] </sup> </p>

    <p>The buildup to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"><a>World War</a> I saw a great demand for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog"></a>police dogs</a>, which led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler. During the First and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"></a>Second World Wars</a>, Rottweilers saw service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance, draught, and guard dogs. </p>

    <p>The Deutscher Rottweiler-Klub (DRK, <em>German Rottweiler Club</em>), the first Rottweiler club in Germany, was founded on 13 January 1914, and followed by the creation of the Süddeutscher Rottweiler-Klub (SDRK, <em> South German Rottweiler Club </em>) on 27 April 1915 and eventually became the IRK (International Rottweiler Club). The DRK counted around 500 Rottweilers, and the SDRK 3,000 Rottweilers. The goals of the two clubs were different. The DRK aimed to produce working dogs and did not emphasise the morphology of the Rottweiler.</p>

    <h3>Temperament</h3>

    
    <p>In the breed standard published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Cynologique_Internationale">Fédération Cynologique Internationale</a> in 2018, the Rottweiler's behaviour/temperament should be: <sup>[3]</sup> </p>

    The Rottweiler is good-natured, placid in basic disposition, very devoted, obedient, biddable and eager to work. His appearance is natural and rustic, his behaviour self-assured, steady and fearless. He reacts to his surroundings with great alertness and at the same time even-tempered. </p>

    <p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kennel_Club"<a> American Kennel Club's</a>  "Official Standard of the Rottweiler," the Rottweiler's temperament should be:

    <sup>[14] </sup> a calm, confident and courageous dog with a self-assured aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships. A Rottweiler is self-confident and responds quietly and with a wait-and-see attitude to influences in its environment. It has an inherent desire to protect home and family, and is an intelligent dog of extreme hardness and adaptability with a strong willingness to work, making them especially suited as a companion, guardian and general all-purpose dog.</p>

    <p>According to the American Rottweiler Club:<sup>[15]</sup>

    For us, Rottweilers are the best breed in the world, but we firmly believe they are not a dog for everyone. Rottweilers require a calm, stable and firm "pack leader" or they will assume that role for you. Puppies and adults need socialization, exercise and stimulating mental challenges. With these things, you will have a wonderful companion; without them, your Rottweiler may become destructive and out of control. </p>

    <p>Rottweilers are a powerful breed with well-developed genetic herding and guarding instincts. Potentially dangerous behaviour in Rottweilers usually results from irresponsible ownership, abuse, neglect, or lack of socialisation and training. However, the exceptional strength of the Rottweiler is an additional risk factor not to be neglected. It is for this reason that breed experts declare that formal training and extensive socialisation are essential for all Rottweilers. According to the AKC, Rottweilers love their owners and may behave in a clownish manner toward family and friends, but they are also protective of their territory and do not welcome strangers until properly introduced. Obedience training and socialization are required.<sup> [14] </sup> </p>

<p>One study published in 2008 found that male Rottweilers have higher confidence, sharpness, and defense and play drives than females.<sup>[16] </sup> </p>

<p> A 2008 study surveying breed club members found that while Rottweilers were average in aggressiveness (bites or bite attempts) towards owners and other dogs, it indicated they tend to be more aggressive than average toward strangers. This aggression appears correlated with watchdog and territorial instincts.<sup>[17] </sup> </p>

<p> In the <em>Rottweiler Handbook</em>, Joan H. Walker states that "The Rottweiler is very territorial", meaning that the owner will have to regularly work with the dog to control its territorial aggressiveness.<sup>[18]</sup> </p>
